Here's how the issue names work:

Small tasks are contained into "Epics", which represent big tasks.

Where relevant, issues will be named "End Goal - Work Remaining".

The right side of the dash could be any of these things:

**Design**: when we must design something (example: "Boss Battle - Design" refers to the task of designing how the boss battle will go - will it involve spikes? The boss monologuing? Et cetera)
**Draw**: when we must sketch something (does not involve the task of deciding what to sketch)
**Implement**: when code needs to be written (does not involve the task of defining how the code should behave)
